            <h1><span class="condensed">Compact</span> Pathfinder Stat Blocks</h1>
            <!-- <hr> -->
         </div>

         <p>Once upon a time I came across <a href="http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.ca/search/label/series%20%28set%20design%29">an article about doing up skeletal location/encounter/scene notes</a>. It's a great technique that lets you see the important parts of a scene at a glance. As a Pathfinder player though, one thing that really held me back form using this system was the stat blocks. You see, the article was written by somebody that DMed an older system&hellip; one that has magnificently concise stat blocks.</p>
         <div class="example">
            <img src="img/troll_stat_block.png" width="364" height="118" />
            <p>Wow, remember those days?</p>
         </div>

         <p>At the time I was running a fairly low-level game, and even a lowly goblin's stat block is pretty big and would dominate my newly streamlined notes. I decided to try paring Pathfinder stat blocks down to the essentials. I ended up trimming <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/troll.html#_troll">this</a> down to this:</p>
         <div class="example">
            <u>Troll</u><br/>
            <strong>lrg</strong>; <strong>init</strong>+2; drkvis60, llvis, scent, <strong>perc</strong>+8; <strong>ac</strong>16 (t11, ff14); <strong>hp</strong> 63; <strong>regen</strong> 5 (acid or fire); <strong>f</strong>+11/<strong>r</strong>+4/<strong>w</strong>+3; <strong>sp</strong>30; <strong>bite</strong> +8/1d8+5, <strong>2 claws</strong> +8/1d6+5; <strong>cmb/d</strong>+10/22; <em>Best 268</em><br/>
            <strong>special</strong>: rend (2 claws/1d6+7)
         </div>
         <p>Not exactly 1e level brevity, but <em>way</em> better. Even when you add a few class levels, things remain fairly legible:</p>
         <div class="example">
            <p><u>Goblin Boomer</u><br/>
            <strong>init</strong>+4; drkvis60, <strong>perc</strong>+7; <strong>ac</strong>14 (t14, ff11); <strong>hp</strong> 36; <strong>f</strong>+5/<strong>r</strong>+8/<strong>w</strong>+0; <strong>sp</strong>20; <strong>bomb</strong>(dc15) +9/3d6+3 fire(splash)/&times;2 or <strong>scrap bmb</strong>(dc15) +9/3d6+3 +3 bleed (ref neagtes)/&times;2 or <strong>immolation bmb</strong>(dc15) +9/1d6+3 fire for 3rnds (full rnd ref neagtes)/&times;2; <strong>cmb/d</strong>+2/15; <em>Perram&#8217;s Goblins</em> 4<br/>
            <strong>special</strong>: mutagen (+2 nat. arm &amp; +4/&#8211;2 to str/int, dex/wis, or con/cha for 50m); pt blnk sht (+1 atk &amp; dmg within 30&prime;); precise bombs (select 3 squares to not be affected by splash effects); precise shot (no &#8211;4 for thrw into melee); ricochet splsh wpn (make atk w/splsh wpn if it misses &amp; lands in an occupied sqr)<br/>
            <strong>spells</strong> (cl5): 2nd (3/d)&#8212;cat&#8217;s grace, blur, defensive shock; 1st (5/d)&#8212;shield, jump, abjuring step, linebreaker, targeted bomb admixture </p>
         </div>

         <p>As it turns out though, paring stat blocks down is a fair bit or work, so <a href="https://plus.google.com/106086671577628767426/posts/UmSTTqYn1B3">I asked on Google+ if anybody had done something similar</a>. Unfortunatly, it seemed that I was breaking new ground. So I continued on my own.</p>

         <p>After a real-life test drive, I've decided that my compact stat blocks work for me. The might not be completely consistent, and they might be overly wordy in some cases (duh, don't you know what point blank shot does?), or missing details in others (xp, levels, skills, etc.). Also, they're limited to what I've needed so far (though I hope to add new monsters and NPCs as I go).</p>

         <!-- <p>Below, you'll find links to html and rtf versions of my compact stat blocks. Please note that these files are generated from a master Markdown document. Sometimes, that conversion doesn't go quite as smoothly as one would hope, so the formatting might be a bit off in places. Your best bet is probably to copy and paste from the html version&hellip; it seems to have the fewest problems.</p>

         <p>html version</p>
         <p>rtf version</p> -->

         <p>Unfortunatly, the way I create the stat blocks is a little convoluted and not really ready for prime time. If you're interested in checking things out and know your way around Mardown and a unix shell prompt, head on over to the <a href="https://github.com/aeakett/pf_compact_stat_blocks">GitHub</a> page. At some point I hope to get the stat blocks in a reasonable viewable form, but for now, my just-in-time method of session prep is holding that back.M/p>
